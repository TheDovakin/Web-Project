            <h1>Welcome to Our Website!</h1>
            <p>The ocean is vast, beautiful, and full of life. It covers over 70% of our planet, produces more than half of the oxygen we breathe, and provides food and livelihoods for billions of people. It is home to extraordinary creatures — from tiny plankton to the mighty blue whale.</p>
            <p><strong>But despite its power, the ocean is under threat.</strong></p>
            <p>Every day, pollution, overfishing, and climate change destroy marine life and habitats. Entire species are disappearing. Coral reefs are bleaching. Plastic waste is filling the seas. Our planet’s blue heart is in trouble.</p>
            <p>That's why we created this website: to raise awareness, share knowledge, and inspire action.</p>
